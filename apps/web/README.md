# @dataask/web (placeholder)

This directory previously contained the standalone Next.js web app. The up-to-date implementation has been moved into the root `app/`, `components/`, and `lib/` so the v0 environment can run agents directly against it.

For now, this package is intentionally empty. The code will be transferred back here later once the v0 agent work stabilizes.

What remains here:
- `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and build artifacts kept only to preserve workspace structure.

Next steps:
- When ready, migrate the root `app/` back into `apps/web/app/` and re-enable this package.
